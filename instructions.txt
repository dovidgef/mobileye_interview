Given a line of letters and spaces, split it to parts so that each part is no longer than 10 symbols, the words of 10 symbols and
less are never split, and there are no unnecessary splits.

Examples: "hi hi hi" -> ["hi hi hi"] and not ["hi" "hi" "hi"]; "hey hey hey" -> ["hey hey", "hey"] or ["hey", "hey hey"]
but not ["hey", "hey", "hey"];
"what a disgusting food" -> ["what a", "disgusting", "food"];
"Avadakedavra alohomora" -> ["Avadakedav", "ra", "alohomora"] or alike, but never ["Avadakedav", "ra alohomo", "ra"].
No optimizations needed, no ideal solution needed. As simple as it is put here.
